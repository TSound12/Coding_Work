# SQL Query Filters and File Updates Assignment

## Overview

This assignment focuses on two key aspects: applying filters in SQL queries to retrieve specific data from a database and creating Python algorithms to update files efficiently. The goal is to demonstrate proficiency in both SQL and Python programming.

## SQL Query Filter

In this section, we explore the application of filters in SQL queries. Filters are crucial for narrowing down the results of a query to obtain specific information. The SQL file (`sql_filters_assignment.sql`) contains examples of queries using various filters, such as `WHERE` clauses, `LIKE` statements, and logical operators.

## Python File Updates

The Python section of the assignment involves developing algorithms for efficiently updating files. The Python script (`file_update_algorithm.py`) showcases a methodical approach to read, modify, and write back data to a file. It emphasizes best practices for file handling, error checking, and algorithmic efficiency.

## Instructions

### SQL Query Filters

1. Open the SQL file (`sql_filters_assignment.sql`) in your preferred SQL environment.
2. Review the queries and understand how filters are applied to retrieve specific data.
3. Experiment with modifying and creating new queries to reinforce your understanding.

### Python File Updates

1. Open the Python script (`file_update_algorithm.py`) in a Python IDE or text editor.
2. Examine the code structure and comments to understand the file update algorithm.
3. Experiment with applying the algorithm to different file types or modifying it to suit specific requirements.

## Example Usage

```bash
# SQL Query Filters
$ sql_command -f sql_filters_assignment.sql

# Python File Updates
$ python file_update_algorithm.py input_file.txt output_file.txt
```
